```{r}

x = matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4), 2, 2)
x = x^2.5
sqrt(x)
```
Here I use rnorm to generates a vector of random normal variables and get the correlation between x and y

```{r}
x = rnorm(50)

y = x + rnorm(50,50,.1)

cor(x,y)
```
useing the same random variables
```{r}
set.seed(1303)

rnorm(50)
```
```{r}
set.seed(1303)

rnorm(50)
```

```{r}
rnorm(50)
```

use mean and var and sd

```{r}
y = rnorm(100)

mean(y)

var(y)

sqrt(var(y))

sd(y)

```
